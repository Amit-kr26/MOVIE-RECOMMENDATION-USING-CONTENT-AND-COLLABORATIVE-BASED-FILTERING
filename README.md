In content-based filtering, movie attributes like title, overview, genres, cast, and crew are used to generate feature vectors. Cosine similarity is then applied to recommend movies with higher similarity scores to the ones a user has liked.

Collaborative filtering focuses on user behaviour and preferences. It recommends movies based on the reactions of similar users, assuming users with similar tastes will enjoy similar movies. It uses KNN algorithm to recommend movies.

A weighted hybrid model combines content-based and collaborative filtering results to create a more accurate recommendation system. The model assigns weights to the recommendations from each approach based on their performance and relevance. By integrating the strengths of both techniques, the weighted hybrid model aims to overcome limitations and provide diverse and accurate movie recommendations.
