# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-USING-CONTENT-AND-COLLABORATIVE-BASED-FILTERING

in content-based filtering, movie attributes like title, overview, genres, cast, and crew are used to generate feature vectors. Cosine similarity is then applied to recommend movies with higher similarity scores to the ones a user has liked.

Collaborative filtering focuses on user behavior and preferences. It recommends movies based on the reactions of similar users, assuming users with similar tastes will enjoy similar movies.It uses knn algorithm to recommend the movies.

To create a more accurate recommendation system, a weighted hybrid model combines the results of both content-based and collaborative filtering. The model assigns weights to the recommendations from each approach based on their performance and relevance. By integrating the strengths of both techniques, the weighted hybrid model aims to overcome limitations and provide diverse and accurate movie recommendations.
